# SOLID

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

The SOLID ideas are

- The single-responsibility principle: *There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.* In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- The openâ€“closed principle: *Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.*
- The Liskov substitution principle: *Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.*
- The interface segregation principle: *Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.*
- The dependency inversion principle: *Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.*
